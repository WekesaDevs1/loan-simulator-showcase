Loan Unlock Simulator (Showcase Version)
Overview

This project demonstrates a new model for loan disbursement and repayment that encourages consistent borrower discipline while reducing default risk. The approach introduces a staged unlocking system, meaning borrowers gradually gain access to more funds as they prove repayment reliability.

This system could be integrated into digital lending platforms, microfinance apps, or fintech wallets to promote trust and financial inclusion.

How It Works

Borrower applies for a loan, e.g., KES 50,000.

The system calculates an initial release amount, for example 50% of the loan.

As the borrower makes consistent daily repayments, the system unlocks additional portions of the remaining balance.

Data science models can later be added to monitor repayment patterns and adjust unlock thresholds.

This staged model prevents complete exposure to defaulters and motivates reliable borrowers by rewarding consistent behavior.

Demo Code Snippets

Python examples that demonstrate basic logic of my proprietary algorithm.

1. Simple Loan Setup
# Basic input setup
loan_amount = 50000
initial_release_percent = 0.5

initial_release = loan_amount * initial_release_percent
locked_amount = loan_amount - initial_release

print(f"Loan requested: {loan_amount}")
print(f"Initial release: {initial_release}")
print(f"Locked amount: {locked_amount}")

2. Simulated Daily Repayments
# Simple repayment simulation
daily_payment = 100
days = 10

total_repaid = daily_payment * days
remaining_balance = loan_amount - total_repaid

print(f"After {days} days, total repaid: {total_repaid}, Remaining balance: {remaining_balance}")

3. Visualizing Repayment Progress
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

days = list(range(1, 31))
repayments = [day * daily_payment for day in days]

plt.plot(days, repayments, label="Total Repaid")
plt.xlabel("Days")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Repayment (KES)")
plt.title("Loan Repayment Progress")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
